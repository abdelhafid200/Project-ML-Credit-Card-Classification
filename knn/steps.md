1. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any, and scaling the features if needed.

2. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Determine which features are relevant for classification. You might need to drop irrelevant features or create new ones based on domain knowledge.

3. **Split Data**: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, you would use around 70-80% of the data for training and the rest for testing.

4. **Choose k**: Decide on the value of k for kNN. This can be done through hyperparameter tuning, often using techniques like cross-validation.

5. **Train the Model**: Fit the kNN model to the training data.

6. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

7. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the performance of your model using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

8. **Iterate**: Based on the performance, you might need to iterate over steps like feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or even try different algorithms.
